# Chug2Puff
Chug2Puff is a visualization tool to help promote users to keep track of their daily water intake. This application was coded in MATLAB and allows the user to input a variety of factors - such as age, gender, weight and exercise activity -
 and will output a reasonable recommended target of how much water the user should consume.

Our group focused on trying to track this daily progress in a friendly manner by displaying the results along with a puffer fish avatar that inflates as the user progressed toward their recommended goal. This application also gives the user an opportunity to graph their results over time whenever they please.

By giving the user a friendly interface that challenges them to meet their target we hope that Chug2Puff will promote a healthier lifestyle in individuals and make them more aware of how much water they are consuming.

We hope you guys enjoy our application. Thank you!
